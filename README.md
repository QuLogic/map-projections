# Map Projections &mdash; A Working Manual
## USGS Professional Paper 1395

This repository contains some reproductions of map projections from [USGS
Professional Paper 1395](http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1395/report.pdf). I have
found this paper to be quite accessible and useful, but sometimes you just
need to be able to try out things yourself.

These are run in an [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), so
you can [view them in rendered form on
nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/QuLogic/map-projections/tree/master/).
